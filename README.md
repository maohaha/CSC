## Introduction/Motivation

Inspired by our software engineering class, we noticed that there is a high demand of exchanging discussion sections at the beginning of the quarter, but it is hard for students to find partners to exchange their discussion sections. Thatâ€™s why we came up with this idea of BruinSwitch which provides a platform for students to exchange information and thus satisfy their needs efficiently.

In addition, BruinSwitch provides services for group project team-up, and parking permits exchange.

### Features

#### Discussion Section Exchange

This section includes two functionalities, which are adding new discussions and modifying existing discussions. For adding new discussions, after logging-in, the user selects desired area of class, then users fill in which discussion section they have already enrolled and which they want to switch to. After users submit the above information, they will return to their profile page. The users can review their updated exchanging information in their profile pages.
After the adding process completed, users can modify or delete their exchanging classes in profile pages.

#### Group project team-up

This section provides users who are in the same discussion to form project groups. The users can either hire team members or join an existing team. From the profile page, users can click team-up icon. The users are required to select area of class to enter their discussion section, and they post hiring or joining information. The dashboard is divided to show hiring or seeking information. After posting, users can review or modify their posts.

#### Parking permits exchanges

This section requires users to enter their current parking lot number, and parking lot number which they want to exchange to. After users submit above information, they will return to their profile page. The users can review or modify their requests.
